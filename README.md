# deitel-cpp-10e

These are my personal solutions to the C++ How to Program 10th ed. text
by Paul and Harvey Deitel. I make no claims to their ultimate correctness.
I have tried to maintain many of the standards expounded upon in the book,
but at times (usually due to stylistic preferences) I depart from these
conventions. Code is generally documented with comments, and I believe 
anyone with C++ experience will be able to, more or less, easily follow
my methodology. As a beginner, I will certainly not always pursue
the most elegant or informed solutions, and will only use the methods
and techniques introduced up to any given exercise, as I believe this is
tacitly intended by the authors, even if it is not stated outright as a 
criterion for a problem.

My computer is a Linux system, and all programs were written in Kate and
compiled by g++ using the C++ 14 standards.
